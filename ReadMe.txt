This is the code of the MC-HDSet matching algorithm proposed in

Jian Hou, Marcello Pelillo, Huaqiang Yuan. Hypergraph matching via game-theoretic hypergraph clustering. Pattern Recognition, vol. 125, 2022.

Dependency

You may need to compile the codes in the "ann_mwrapper" and "vlfeat-0.9.19" folders. These two third-party libraries are used in approximate knn and SIFT feature extraction.

Usage

Simply run demo_mchdset.m for a demonstration of the matching process.

Tested with Matlab R2010b.
